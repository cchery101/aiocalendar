The All-In-One Calendar is a an all inclusive calendar feature that can be easily downloaded and installed to give you a complete calendar solution for your Drupal website.

AIOcalendar requires the [Features module](http://drupal.org/project/features) from [Drupal.org](http://drupal.org) as well as a handful of other modules. In addition to the standard calendar views, you will also find a list/agenda view of all your events that is a much clearer way to see upcoming events. Additionally you will find two blocks, a min-calendar block as well as a list view block.
